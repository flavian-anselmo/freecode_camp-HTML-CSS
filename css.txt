CSS{
    USE of css class to style elements 
    classes are reusable style that can be added 
    to html elements 
    <h1 class="blue-text">hello</h1>
    <style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
    </style
    you can see that we have created a css class called blue-text
    within the <style> tag
    NOTE:in your css style class names start with 
    a period or [.]
    
}
style multiple elements with a css class{
    classes allow you to use the same css style on  multiple
    html elements 
    just specify thesame classs to different elements
    they will get same characteristics

}
fonts{
    font size is controlled by the font-size css property
    h1{
        font-size:30px
    }
    set the font family of an elements
    use the font family property
    h1{
        font-family:san-serif;
    }
    Import google fonts{
        in addition to specyfying common fonts that 
        are found on most os we can also specify
        non standard custom web fonts for use on our website
        -google font library{
            google fonts is free library of web 
            fonts that you can use in your css by referncing 
            the font url
            google font will direct you how to use thesame
            <link>->when using link it should be obove the style elements
            then check how google wants you to write the font-famil:family_name,generic_name;

        }
    }
    specify how fonts should degrade{
        when a font is not available you can tell the browser 
        to degrade to another font
        for example if you wanted an element to use 
        the Helvitica font but degraade to san-serif  font
        when Helvitica is not available

        p{
            font-family:Helvitica,sans-serif;
        }

    }
    size image{
        css has aproperty called width that controls
        an elements width just like font we will 
        use px to specify the image width
        eg->craete a class large-image that gave htmlelements
        a width with of 500px
    }
    add border around your element{
        css border have properties like style,color and width
        you can apply mmultiple classes to an element using 
        its class attribute by sepaerating each class name with 
        space eg<img "class1 class2">
    }
    Add rounded corners with borderradius{
        AN image can have sharp corners we can round out those 
        corners with a css property called [border-radius]
        One can specify it pixels 
        border-radius can be specified using px or precentage
        border-radius:10px;
        border-radius:50%;//this makes the image more circular
    }
    Give a backgraound color to a Div element{
        use the background-color property
        one can create a class 
        div is used inroder to format a particular section of the page 
    }
    set the id of an element{
        each html element can have an id attribute
        benefits of using id attribute{
            you can have an id to style a single 
            element and later you will learn that you can use them to select 
            and modify specific element withJS 

        }
        use id element attribute to style an element {
            one cool thing about id attribute is that like classes you can 
            style them using css
            however an id is not reusable 
            an  id has a higher importannce than a class 
            so if both are applied to the same element and have 
            conflicting styles the styles of the id will be applied
            use the id in the style eg{
                #cat-photo-element{
                    backgraound-color:green;
                }
                when using classes a period is used or [.]
                but when using id of an element you will use 
                #id{

                }

            }
        }
        adjust the padding of an element{
            all html elements are essentially little rectangles 
            Three imortant properties control the space that 
            surrounds each html element :{
                -padding
                -border
                -margin
            }
        }
        add a negative margine to an element{
            an element margin controls the amount
            of space between an element border and 
            surrounding elements
            if you set an element margin to negative 
            the element will grow larger and if
            the margin is positive it will grow smaller
        }
        add different padding to each side of an element{
            some times one needs to customize an
            element so that it has different amounts of
            padding on each of its sides 
            css allows one to controll all the four sides 
            of an element with{
                -padding-top
                -padding-right
                -padding-bottom
                -padding-left

            }
        }
        add different margins to each side of an element{
            some times you would want to customize an element 
            so that it has a different margin on each of its sides
            css allows you to control the amargin of all foursides 
            of an element {
                -margin-top
                -margin-right
                -margin-bottom
                -margin-left
            }
        }
        use clock wise notatiion to specify the padding of an elemnt{
            instead of specifying an element padding-top,padding-bottom.....etc
            you can specify them in one line 
            eg padding:10px 20px 10px 20px;
            these four values work like a clock top,right,bottom,left

        }
        use clockwise notation to specify the margin of an element{
            intead of using margin-top etc
            just use margin:10px 20px 10px 20px
            the four values move in a clockwise fashion
        }
        use attributes selectors to style elements{
            we have used id or class attributes to elemets that 
            you wish to specify style
            thereare othercss selectors you can use to select 
            custom groups of elemets to style
            -we can use attributes eg [attribute=value]
            attributes selectors to style the check box 
            -THis selectors matches and styles elements 
            with specific attribute value for example the 
            below changes margins of all elements with 
            the attribute type and a corresponding value radio
            [type='radio']{
                margin:20px 0px 20px;
            }

        }
        understand absolute versus relative units{
            pixels are type of lenghth unit which is what tells
            the browser how to size or space an item 
            in addition to px css has many different length units 
            options that one can use 
            -in for inches 
            -mm for milimeters
            relative units such as em or rem
            em is based on the elements font 
            you van use it to set the font size
        }
        style the HTML body ekement {
            the body element ca be manipulated 
            background-color:color

        }
        inherit styles from the body element{
            <style>
                body {
                background-color: black;
                color:green;
                font-family:monospace;
            }

            </style>
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        }
        prioritize one style over another {
            sometimes your html elements will recieve 
            multiple styles that conflict with one another
            for example your h1 element cant be both green 
            and pink at the same time 

            if body has a different color for text and a specific
            element has a class that styles with  a different color 
            the color for body willl be overwritten
            eg{
                  <style>
                body {
                background-color: black;
                color:green;
                font-family:monospace;
                .pink-text{
                    color:pink;
                }
            }

            </style>
            <h1 class="pink-text">Hello World</h1>
            }

        }
        override styles in subsequent css{
            -our classes will over ride the body 
            element 
            -what about we have two classes in one element
            the second class will over riide the second one 
            The browser reads css from top to bottom
            hence style declaration from the bottom will 
            over ride the top incase of conflict 
            using id attribute overide almost all
            using inline style overides all again plus id
            to over ride all styles use important
        }
        over ride all other styles by using important {
            this is the most important an powerfull wa to 
            over ride 
            Why you should over ride {
                in many cases you will use css libraries 
                this may accidentally overide your own cssso when
                so when you want too be sure you can use 
                
                !important 
                
                 .pink-text {
                    color: pink !important;
                 }
            }
        }
        use CSS variables to change several elements at once{
            css vaibles are a powerful way to change 
            many css style properties at once by canging 
            only one value 
        }

    }
