<!--
    when working with css you will likely run 
    into compatin=bility issues at the same ppoint 
    this is why it is important to provide 
    browser fallback to avoid potential problems
    when your browser parses tthe css of a webpage
    it ignores any properties that it doesnt 
    recogonise or support for example{
        if you use a css variable to assign a bbackground color
        on a site eg internet explorer will ignore 
        the background color bbecause it does not support csss
        variables 
    }
