Accessibility is basicaly having web content
and a userinterface that can be understood 
navigated aand interacted with by a brosd audience 
    -this includes :
        -visual,auditory,mobility,and cognitive disabilities 
-here i will learn how to:
    -create an easily navigated page that is keyboard friendly
    -ensure text alternativeness exist for non text and visual content
    -have well organised code thet uses appropriate markup
 add a text alternative to image for visual impared accessibility{
     its likely that you have seen the alt attribute
     on an image tag ...alt describes the content of the amage 
     This helps in cases where the image fails to load 

     syntax:<img src="link.jpg" alt="logo">
     pple with visual impairments rely on 
     screen readers to convert web content to audio 
     interface 
 }           
know when the alt text should be left balnk{
    in situations when the image is already 
    explained with text content or does not
    add meaning to the page the img still needs 
    an alt but it can be st to empty

} 
use heading to show hierachical relationship of content{
    headings h1-h6 are workhorse tags that help 
    provide structure and labeling to your content
    screen readers 
    inshort use different heading to avoid cofusion
    ->h1 should only be one
}
jumo straight to the content using main element{
    html5 introduced a number if new elements 
    that give developers more options while also
    incoperating  feartures these tags are :
            -footer
            -nav
            -article
            -section
}
by default the browser wil render this elements 
similar to <div>
The tag name can can indicate the type of information
it contains which adds semantic meaning to that content 
<main>->should have the main content of the page

wrap text in the article element{
    <article>->this is a section element and is used 
    to wrap indeendent self contained content
    this tag works well with blog entries
    forum posts and new artiicles 
    article is for stand alone content
    -section is for grouping thematically related content
    for example if a book is an article then each chapter
    is an a section

    div->group content
    section->group related content
    article->self contained content
}

make screen reader navigation easier with the header landmark{
    header araps introductory info
    header is meant to be used inn the body


}
the nav landmark{
    nav element is another html5 item with 
    emebended landmark feature for easy screen reader
    navis for navigation around the website
    other links use the footer if the links are at the end of the website
}

the footer{
    contains copyright information

}

improove accessibility of audio content with the audio element{
    html5 element gives semantic meaning 
    when it wraps sound or audio stream content 
    in your markup
    -the audio tag supports the control attributes 
    teh browser default eg play pause  

    <audio id="meowClip" controls>
        <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
        <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
    </audio>
    multimedia content ususally has both visual and auditory
    components ...it needs synchronised captiion 
    and a transcript so users with visual
    and auditory impairedness can access it 
    The control attribute provides capabilities such as 
    pause play ...volume etc.....
}
improve chart accessibility with the figure element{
    html5 introduces [figure] element along with the related [figcaption]
    used together ,these items wrap a visual representation like img diagram
    or chart along with its caption 
    the figcaption goes inside the figure tags and can be combined 
    with other elements 

    <figure>
        <img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
        <br>
        <figcaption>
             Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
}
improve form accebility with the label element{
    label tag wraps the text for a specific form controlitem 
    usually the name or label for choice this ties meaning to the item 
    and makes the form more readable 
    the for attribute on a label tags explicitly
    associatesb that label with the form control and is used screenreaders 
    the for and id should be same 

    <form>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    </form>
}
wrap radio buttons in a field set element for better accebility{
    each choice isgiven a label with for attribute tying with id
    but since radio buttons often come in a group where the user 

    must choose one ..there is a way to semantically show 
    the choices are a part of a set
    -the fieldset tag suorrounds the entire grouping
    of radio buttons to achieve this 
    it often uses a legend tag to provide a description 
    for the grouping which is read by screen readers 

    <form>
        <fieldset>
        <!--legend provides description 
            for the buttons the fieldset
            decribes that the buttons belong
            to one set-->
            <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
            <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
            <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
            <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
            <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
            <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
            <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
        </fieldset>
    </form>

}
add an accessible date picker{
    forms often include the input field
    which can be used to create several 
    different form controls 
    one can create a date picker using 
    the input element

    <label for="input1">Enter a date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="input1" name="input1">
    -html5 introduces the time element 
    along with a datetime attribute to standardize 
    times .this is an inline element that can wrap 
    a date or time on a page 
    A valid format of that date is held by datetime
    attribute 


}
{
    when creating links make it descriptive 
    so that screen readers can know wjat the thw link is all about
}
make links navigable with html accesskeys{
    html offers the acccess keys attributes to specify a shortcut to activate 
    or bring focus to an element 
    this can make navigation more efficient for keyboard only users 

    <button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>

    the buuton can be accessed by pressing enter
}
use tabindex to add keyboard focus to element{
    tabindex has three distinct functions
    relating to an element keyboard focus 
    this functionality can be given
    to elements such as div span and p
    by placing a tabindex ="0"

    <div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>

    allows the user to tab through the page form the first 
    part that has been set with tabindex

    tabindex also allows as to use the focus psuedo-element 
    p:focus{
        background-color:yellow;
        /*this will highlight the part with yelllow 
        the part that has the tab index*/
    }

    the focus of keyboard for several elements can be specified 

    <div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>

    <div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>
