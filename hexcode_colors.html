    other ways of representing colors
    this is called hexadecimal code 
    we ususally use decimal or base 10 numbers 
    which use the symbol 0 to 9 for each digit
    hex are base 16 numbers this means that it uses 
    16 distict sysmbols like 0-F
    IN CSS we can use 6 hex digit to represent 
    colors two each for red green blue #oooooo is black
