    noemally positioned

    The CSS offsets of top or bottom, 
    and left or right tell the browser 
    how far to offset an item relative 
    to where it would sit in the normal 
    flow of the document. You're offsetting 
    an element away from a given spot, which 
    moves the element away from the referenced 
    side (effectively, the opposite direction). 
    As you saw in the last challenge, using the
     top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, 
     using a left 
    offset moves an item to the right.
